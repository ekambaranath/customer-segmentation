**About the Project:**

Problem : Customer segmentation

- [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data)
Implementation: I have taken inspiration from [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data), and implemented in Tensorflow 2.0, and have deployed it using Flask application.

Task :

- Analyzing the content of the E-Commerce database that contains the purchases made by approximate ~4000 customers over a period of one year

- To develop a model that allows to anticipate or predict the purchases that will be made by a new customer during the following & this year, based on the data available from the previous purchases. Steps :

- Data Preparation

- Exploring the content of variables (in short, Exploratory Data Analysis, not inlcuding the product category)

- Intuitions about the categories of the product, the customer buys

- Categories of the Customer that buys the product

- Classifying the Customers based on some parameters

- Testing the Predictions
